The API provides possibility to retrieve a list of transactions (original first presentments received from the card schemes), based on certain criteria.

At least one of the following criteria for searching must be provided: • PAN • PAN token • Transaction identifier • Acquirer reference number • Virtual Service Card Number • Card Identifier • Account Identifier

If requested, the API allows also to: • search from an issuer and optionally with sub-issuers OR search from a list of issuers (by default, the search is performed on all issuers allowed for the user depending on its rights) • return only certain transactions (disputed transactions, fraudulent transactions) • request to enrich the response with additional data relative to addendum (to retrieve lodging information, car rental information, air itinerary information) by using embedded fields

The API response contains all matched transactions sorted by descending transaction date.
